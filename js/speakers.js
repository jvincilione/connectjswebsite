Creating a “good form” that is semantic while also providing the user with a pleasant experience however is a tricky business. It requires a keen understanding of the user experience to build out a good engaging workflow and a willingness to finagle input elements to your bidding. Thankfully, the template syntax in VueJS alongside its state management system lends itself well to creating semantic web forms that also respond seamlessly to user input. In this talk, we will explore various patterns and strategies to building semantic and robust forms in VueJS while also ensuring a delightful and engaging user experience.'

      description: 'ReactJS has quickly become a front-end developer favorite for creating web applications. One of the key features is its component-focused approach for building applications. A new paradigm, CSS-in-JS was created, to help improve developer experience when developing component-based applications. In this session, we\'ll start by discussing component-based design and how it differs from traditional design. We will move to discussing CSS-in-JS and benefits it provides when building component-based applications. Finally, we will cover one of the more popular CSS-in-JS libraries for ReactJS, styled-components. This talk will enable attendees to start using styled-components in their own ReactJS application.'

Static sites provide significant benefits - performance, security, durability, ease of deployment - to developers, content creators, and consumers alike. Not all static site generators are created equal, however. Gatsby supercharges the process and brings many unique strengths to the table, including a strong plugin ecosystem, a data fetching layer based on GraphQL, the ability to collate data from multiple data sources, and Progressive Web App functionality infused into the static sites it generates. Together, we\'ll explore these strengths and more as we delve into why Gatsby is one of the top static site generators in the industry.'

This difference can lead to confusion and frustration for many developers. \n You may have worked with objects in JavaScript, but how do they work? What\'s a constructor function or an object prototype? How does inheritance work?\nThis talk offers attendees a deep dive into the JavaScript Object Model. You\'ll leave this talk understanding the differences between anonymous object literals and object types, how to build up prototypical inheritance, and how JavaScript\'s class syntax effectively bridges the gap between the underlying object implementation and the classical defintion style many developers are more comfortable with.'

RxJS provides much cleaner and precise way to handle asynchronous data streams, i.e. by using Reactive Programming approach. It opens up a continuous channel of communication in which multiple values of data can be emitted over time. \n\n In this talk, we will discuss the latest version of RxJS library, i.e. version 6 and what does it offer. With the latest release of Angular 6, it\'s a mandatory dependency there.
